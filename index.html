        For this assignment I made a website dedicated to one of my favorite book and movie series of all time: Harry Potter. 
        I have been a passionate fan of the series for many years and thought it would be fun to express the magic of the series 
        and my love for it through this project. In order to convey this magic, I decided to use a starry background, along with 
        white and gold colors that complement each other and appeal to the user’s eye. To experiment with HTML and CSS, I chose 
        to use icons that expand when hovered over, and showcase new information when clicked on. This is a much more dynamic 
        way for the user to learn more about me and my interest, rather than simply being shown the information upon opening 
        the site. Additionally, I included two visuals for each of my sections, which allows the user to better understand what 
        I am speaking on, no matter their familiarity with the series. The most exciting element I learned to include is 
        animating the wand to move across the screen and make the website appear, I think it really adds to the fantastical 
        topic and catches the user’s attention. I had a lot of challenges with various components of the website, particularly 
        with properly organizing the different sections (title, icons, information, and footer) vertically, especially in a 
        responsive manner. Some of the sections would overlap each other and block each other from view in some or all layouts. 
        For example, there were many cases where the information section would leave a big gap between itself and the icons 
        above it. The footer would also block some of the last bits of text, so that they could not be read. However, by using 
        flex through different divisions and groups of elements, I was able to create a satisfying display.

                    Hello, my name is Rawan! I am a member of the house of Hufflepuff, one of the four houses of Hogwarts. 
                    This house, founded by Helga Hufflepuff, values loyalty, patience, hard work, and dedication. 
                    My house's mascot is a badger, and my house's signature colors are black and yellow. 
                    The patronus (or defensive spell that takes the appearance of an animal) I connect with most is the 
                    brown hare, which is associated with patience, intelligence, and shyness.
                    If I really was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, I would be most interested in 
                    Charms (or spellcasting) and broom flying.

                    These are my ultimate favorites from the Harry Potter universe! My top characters are George and Fred Weasley, 
                    identical twin brothers known for their brilliantly mischievous pranks and the founders of their joke shop 
                    Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes in the streets of Diagon Alley. My favorte wand belongs to Hermione Granger, I 
                    absolutely love the vine pattern since I am a big fan of anything with plant designs. It's hard to choose my 
                    favorite book out of all 7, but my top two are "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" and "Harry Potter and the 
                    Order of the Phoenix". Not only are both books packed with exciting details about Harry and his friend's adventures, 
                    entertaining and captivting the reader, but also mark a high point for one of the most important arcs of the 
                    series: the return of the evil wizard Voldemort.

                    My most memorable wizarding adventures have been my trips to Harry Potter World in both Universal Studios
                    Hollywood and Orlando. The experience of immersing myself in the magical world that I've grown to love and 
                    form strong connections with over the years was exciting and heart-warming. I particularly enjoyed the size 
                    of Harry Potter world in Orlando since it includes two giant halves of one whole spread across the two parks 
                    (such as the infamous streets of Diagon Alley) and even the opportunity to ride the Hogwarts Express train in 
                    between the parks! I also really liked trying the butterbeer, a sweet and fizzy non-alcoholic drink from the series with 
                    a butterscotch foam on top.
